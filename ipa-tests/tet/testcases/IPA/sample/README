# This is the information file for the test suite refered above.  Please, add as
# many infos as possible regarding this test suite in the current file. Organize
# this file as you want. Here are  some examples of infos one would like to find
# here:
# 
#   - Test number tp_54 fails because of bug #123456 in the server
# 
#   - Test number  tp_11 fails because  of a bug  in the  test suite  that still
#     needs to be identified
# 
#   - On some unknown circumstances, under AIX, test number_02 returns NORESULT
# 
#   - If you have  the message "xxx...xxx" in the test log,  then it is probably
#     due to a bad IROOT parameter in your engage.hostname.cfg file
# 
#   - This suite is not  launched on a daily base, because it  takes more than 2
#     hours to do the run
# 
#   - ...
# 
# Do as if  the reader of this  document is looking at engage's  results for the
# first time: help him to understand what is wrong.
