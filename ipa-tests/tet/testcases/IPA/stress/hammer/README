This test suite is to stress test the KDC thats part of the IPA server
 primarily to stress the kdc-ldap connectivity with a tool called the
 hammer.


How to run this test:

(1) setup an ipa server
(2) run ipa-config-change.bash script 
	- changes maxuserlength to a large value
	- replaces ipa-adduser script with our own which doesn't do any username validation
(3) run the adduser script to populate the database. 
    - this script adds the user and sets password expiration 

(4) run run.bash script which launches hammer
