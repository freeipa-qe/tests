Topology:

The quick install script will install a Directory Server, either from
the tar file, or from a directory where Directory Server has already
been extracted to. It will then do some checks to find the largest,
writable disk slice. It will then get the install information from the 
engage configuration file to determine the source for the installation 
media, the server root, port, directory manager uid, and password for 
directory manager.

none

Missing Test Cases:
