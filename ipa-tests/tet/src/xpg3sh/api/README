SCCS: @(#)README	1.14 (96/08/15)
TETware release 3.7

The files in this directory constitute the TETware Application
Programming Interface (API), Shell language binding.

The files are shell scripts written for use with a Shell command interpreter
that conforms to the sh specification in Volume 1 of the X/OPEN Portability
Guide Issue 3.  An example of this might be a Bourne Shell that includes
support for shell functions.  In addition certain common utilities are
used; attempts have been made to avoid utilities and/or features that may
vary between implementations.

After running make the following files are available in the directory
$(TET_ROOT)/lib/xpg3sh for use with applications:

	tcm.sh		Shell Test Case Manager

	tetapi.sh	Shell API support routines.


Note - Signal Handling.

Since signals are specified in the Shell by means of numbers rather than
symbolic names, it will be necessary to inspect the lists of signals
and "SH_NSIG" value in the makefile and check that they are correct for
your implementation.

In addition, it should be noted that the Shell may not know about all the
signals that may occur in a particular implementation and attempts to
handle unknown signals are often treated as fatal errors.  Such signal
numbers must either be added to the list of unhandled signals or must
be avoided by reducing SH_NSIG to less than the "real" NSIG value.

The SH_NSIG value in the makefile can be overriden by setting TET_NSIG
when shell test cases are executed, either in the execution configuration
file or in the environment.


Note - Awk.

In order to fulfill the requirements of the Shell API Specification, the
awk utility has been used to format lines in the Results file.  It should
be noted that some awk implementations are limited in their capacity to
handle long lines; if this is the case, it will limit the length of a line
that may be passed to tet_infoline or tet_result.
