# NAME:		hpux9.mk
# PRODUCT:	TETware
# AUTHOR:	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd.
# DATE CREATED:	February 1995
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	common machine-dependent definitions used in makefiles
#	this file is included in lower level makefiles
#
#	this one for HP/UX R9 using sockets and inetd
# 
# MODIFICATIONS:
# 
#	Geoff Clare, UniSoft Limited, July-Oct 1996
#	Changes for TETWare.
# 
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., July 1998
#	Added support for shared API libraries.
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., August 1999
#	Added support for the Java API.
#

# tccd can be started:
#	from /etc/inittab (SYSV systems)
#	from /etc/inetd (BSD4.3 style)
#	from /etc/rc (BSD4.2 style)
#	interactively by a user
#
# inittab systems should include -DINITTAB in DTET_CDEFS below
# inetd systems should include -DINETD in DTET_CDEFS below
# [ Not relevant for TETware-Lite ]

# TCCD should be either in.tccd (INETD defined) or tccd
# [ Not used when building TETware-Lite ]

#	TET_CDEFS are used to compile most source files
#	    these should include -D_POSIX_SOURCE 
#	    you may want to define TET_SIG_IGNORE and TET_SIG_LEAVE here
#
#	DTET_CDEFS are used to compile source files which use non-POSIX
#	features, such as networking and threads
#	    for example:
#	    inet:  DTET_CDEFS = -D_ALL_SOURCE -DINETD

# Set JAVA_CDEFS to JAVA_NOT_SUPPORTED if Java is not supported on your

# NOTE that the Java API is only supported on certain platforms - see the
# Installation Guide and/or the Release Notes for details.
