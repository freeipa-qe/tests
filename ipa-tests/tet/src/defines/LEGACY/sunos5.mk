#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	common machine-dependent definitions used in makefiles
#	this file is included in lower level makefiles
#
#	this one for SunOS 5.x (a.k.a. Solaris 2.x) using sockets and inetd,
#	UI threads supported.
#
# MODIFICATIONS:
#	Geoff Clare, UniSoft Limited, Sept-Oct 1996
#	Added comments on THR_COPTS and C_PLUS.
#	Changes for TETware-Lite.
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., August 1998
#	Added support for shared API libraries.
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., August 1999
#	Added support for the Java API.

# tccd can be started:
#	from /etc/inittab (SYSV systems)
#	from /etc/inetd (BSD4.3 style)
#	from /etc/rc (BSD4.2 style)
#	interactively by a user
#
# inittab systems should include -DINITTAB in DTET_CDEFS below
# inetd systems should include -DINETD in DTET_CDEFS below
# [ Not relevant for TETware-Lite ]

# TCCD should be either in.tccd (INETD defined) or tccd
# [ Not used when building TETware-Lite ]
