# NAME:		sunos56.mk
# PRODUCT:	TETware
# AUTHOR:	updates to sunos5.mk supplied by Lee Damico, Sun Microsystems
# DATE CREATED:	August 1998
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	common machine-dependent definitions used in makefiles
#	this file is included in lower level makefiles
#
#	this one for Solaris 2.6 using sockets and inetd,
#	POSIX threads supported.
#
# MODIFICATIONS:
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., August 1999
#	Added support for the Java API.
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., November 1999
#	added example setting for JAVA_CDEFS
#	NOTE: not tested - the value of -DTET_SIG_LEAVE might not be
#	correct for Solaris 2.6.

# tccd can be started:
#	from /etc/inittab (SYSV systems)
#	from /etc/inetd (BSD4.3 style)
#	from /etc/rc (BSD4.2 style)
#	interactively by a user
#
# inittab systems should include -DINITTAB in DTET_CDEFS below
# inetd systems should include -DINETD in DTET_CDEFS below
# [ Not relevant for TETware-Lite ]

# TCCD should be either in.tccd (INETD defined) or tccd

#
#	DTET_CDEFS are used to compile source files which use non-POSIX
#	features, such as networking and threads

# support for Java
#
# JAVA_CDEFS is used in addition to TET_CDEFS/DTET_CDEFS when compiling
# the Java API.
# It is normally set to -Ipath-to-jdk-include-directory
# and includes a list of signals that the TCM should leave alone.
# Set JAVA_CDEFS to JAVA_NOT_SUPPORTED if Java is not supported on your
# system or if you don't want to build the Java API.
# NOTE that the Java API is only supported on certain platforms - see the
# Installation Guide and/or the Release Notes for details.
#
# For example, on Solaris 2.6, it might be set to something like this:
#
#	JAVA_CDEFS = -I$(JDK)/include -I$(JDK)/include/solaris \
#		-DTET_SIG_LEAVE='SIGLWP,SIGCANCEL,SIGSEGV,SIGABRT,SIGBUS,\
#			SIGILL,SIGEMT,SIGFPE,SIGSYS,SIGTRAP,SIGXCPU,\
#			SIGXFSZ,SIGPIPE,SIGUSR1'
#
# where $(JDK) is the place where the JDK is installed on your machine.
# NOTE: the signal list in this example is the one that works
# with JDK v1.1 using native threads on Solaris 2.7.
# This signal list is different in different implementations and
# IT MIGHT NOT BE CORRECT FOR Solaris 2.6!!
# So for now I must say:
JAVA_CDEFS = JAVA_NOT_SUPPORTED
#
# JAVA_COPTS is used in addition to COPTS when compiling the Java API.
