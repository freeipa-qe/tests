#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	common machine-dependent definitions used in makefiles
#	this file is included in lower level makefiles
#
#	this one for generic SVR4 using sockets and inetd, no threads.
#	(threads are supported in separate files for specific SVR4 variants)
#
# MODIFICATIONS:
#
#	Denis McConalogue, UniSoft Limited, September 1993
#	added shell API variable definitions
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd, November 1993
#	removed -Xt from COPTS
#	added -lgen to SYSLIBS so as to allow compilation across
#	the entire SVR4 family
#
#	Geoff Clare, UniSoft Limited, July-Oct 1996
#	Changes for TETWare.
# 
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., July 1998

# In Distributed TETware, tccd can be started:
#	from /etc/inittab (SYSV systems)
#	from /etc/inetd (BSD4.3 style)
#	from /etc/rc (BSD4.2 style)
#	interactively by a user (not recommeded!)
#
# inittab systems should include -DINITTAB in DTET_CDEFS below
# inetd systems should include -DINETD in DTET_CDEFS below
# [ Not relevant for TETware-Lite ]

# TCCD specifies the name by which tccd is to be known; this should be in.tccd
# if you define INETD, otherwise it should be tccd
# [ Not used when building TETware-Lite ]

#	DTET_CDEFS are used to compile source files which use non-POSIX
#	features, such as networking and threads
