# NAME:		dynix.mk
# PRODUCT:	TETware
# AUTHOR:	Andrew Josey, The Open Group
# DATE CREATED:	September 1998
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	common machine-dependent definitions used in makefiles
#	this file is included in lower level makefiles
#
#	this one for Dynix/ptx using sockets and inetd, no threads.
#	(threads are supported in separate files for specific SVR4 variants)
#
# MODIFICATIONS:
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., March 1999
#	Integrated into the TETware source tree (but not tested).
#
#	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., August 1999
#	Added support for the Java API.
# 
# ************************************************************************

# tccd can be started:
#	from /etc/inittab (SYSV systems)
#	from /etc/inetd (BSD4.3 style)
#	from /etc/rc (BSD4.2 style)
#	interactively by a user
#
# inittab systems should include -DINITTAB in DTET_CDEFS below
# inetd systems should include -DINETD in DTET_CDEFS below
# [ Not relevant for TETware-Lite ]

# TCCD should be either in.tccd (INETD defined) or tccd
# [ Not used when building TETware-Lite ]

#
#	DTET_CDEFS are used to compile source files which use non-POSIX
#	features, such as networking and threads
