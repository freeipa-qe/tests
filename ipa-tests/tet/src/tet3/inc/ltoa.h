NAME:		ltoa.h
PRODUCT:	TETware
AUTHOR:		Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd.
DATE CREATED:	April 1992

DESCRIPTION:
	a header file for use with the num-to-ascii conversion functions

MODIFICATIONS:
	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., February 1994
	prepended tet_ to function names
	added macros to map short names

	Geoff Clare, UniSoft Ltd., August 1996
	Use sizeof to determine buffer length required.

	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd., July 1998
	Added support for shared API libraries.
