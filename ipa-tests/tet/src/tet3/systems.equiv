# NAME:		systems.equiv
# PRODUCT:	TETware
# AUTHOR:	Andrew Dingwall, UniSoft Ltd.
# DATE CREATED:	June 1992
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	example systems.equiv file for the TETware INET implementation
#
#	each entry in this file defines the host name or Internet address of
#	a system that is permitted to log on to the tccd daemon;
#	an entry should appear in this file to enable the tcc which runs on
#	a particular system to log on to tccd on that system
#
#	a systems.equiv file should exist in the home directory for
#	the user tet (as specified in /etc/passwd), on each system
#	that runs tccd
#
#	if tccd is invoked with the -u option to use a different user ID,
#	the systems.equiv file should instead exist in the home directory
#	of the specified user
#
#	if gethostbyaddr(3) would return a system's host name, then
#	an entry in this file should consist of that name;
#	otherwise an entry should consist of the system's Internet
#	address in dot notation
