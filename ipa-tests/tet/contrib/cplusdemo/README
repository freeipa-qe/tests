@(#)etet/contrib/cplusdemo/README	1.2

This is the standard TET1.10 demo modified to use C++.
The tests have their own subdirectories rather than a common
directory as in the standard demo; this is better.

This is merely a demonstration of the capability.

If this fails to build on your system checkout the individual
makefiles. For example the definitions for CC and CFLAGS will
need changing for GNU g++; examples are given for SunOS4.1.

The defaults are known to work with USL C++ 3.0.2 on SVR4.2.
