This is the a very simple demo to use the TCL API.
This is merely a demonstration of the capability.

This version assumes that tcl is in /usr/local/bin/tcl,
edit the ts/test1.tcl file to change that.

test1.tcl:

   illustrates startup/cleanup with some simple pass and fail results

test2.tcl

   a very simple test case

test3.tcl
     
This  generates in addition an INSPECT result.

By executing as 
 tcc -e -vmessage="mymessage" -y test3 contrib/tcldemo -p
 you can change the behaviour
