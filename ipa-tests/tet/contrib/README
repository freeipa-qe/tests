contrib- 3.7a    June 2006

This directory contains the unsupported user-contributed software.
This distribution is for use with TET3.7.

Please be aware that this software has been designed by its contributors
to work on UNIX operating systems.  It is likely that some changes will be 
required in order to make this software work on the 
Windows NT operating system, see each demo to see whether it has been 
ported to NT.

	configtool - a configure shell script to simplify installation
		of TETware

	demo - is a simple demo test suite to illustrate the capabilities
		of TETware. Follow the instructions in the readme file.


	demo110 - is the standard simple TET1.10 demo, with an additional
	       scenario etet_scen to demo some of the ETET extensions.
	       To run this demo on Windows NT , use the NT makefile
	       (nt.mk)


	win32demo.zip - is the simple demo test suite ported to Win32.


	cplusdemo - a simple C++ demo. This is the standard TET1.10 demo
		written in C++ with minor extensions to demonstrate the
		tet_exec() call in the C++ API. See the README.NT file
		for notes on porting to Windows NT. This version is written
		to run under TETware.

	perldemo - a simple Perl demo. This is equivalent to the 
		standard TET 1.10 demo. 

	remotedemo - a simple demonstration that runs a test of tests
		written to run on a single system,
		simultaneously on a number of remote systems.

	NTperldemo - the same Perl demo above, but ported to Windows NT.

	capi -  the is the C API demo suite from the TETware Programmers
	        Guide. This has been extended over that described in the Guide
		to include  some additional build tools and a sample
		report writer. This test suite tests the chmod, uname, fileno
		and stat interfaces.

	SHELL-API - this is the Shell API demo suite from the 
		TETware Programmers Guide. See the README file
		for instructions on how to execute this.

	scripts - this contains some sample reporting scripts which
		process journal files. These are written in awk, perl and C.

	tetreport - a report tool written in perl , together with
		perl class libraries and documentation for generating
		custom report formats.

	crpt - report writer tools written in C, including a comparative
		report writer - binaries for win32 systems are included

	php-cli_api - this is a contributed PHP binding for TETware.

	ruby_api - this is a contributed Ruby binding for TETware.

	python_api - the contributed Python binding for TETware.
		This is included here for use with the unsupported TET3.
		(TETware support customers should use the supported Python
		API included in TETware 3.8.)

	tclapi - this is a contributed TCL API binding for TETware.
		You need to use this with the TclX distribution that
		supports signal handling.

	tcldemo - this is simple demo test using the TCL API.

	suite - is a test suite for the ETET, which tests both TET
	        base functionality for Perl, Shell and C API's as
		well as ETET extensions.

		This suite runs the suites under the contrib/api and
		contrib/napi directories.

	usltools - a sample buildtool and awk script to generate summary
		results.

	sun_lib - some sample library routines built upon the TET
	       API to make it simpler to use.

	port - a TET portability library for  BSD systems (taken from the
		MIT X test suite release 1.2).  The portability library 
		may be useful as a base for porting the TET to
		other non-POSIX systems, however the portability library 
		is designed to run on a BSD system, and will not 
		necessarily build without change on other systems.

       kshdapi - distributed Korn Shell API


To run the test suites provided here, please check for any README
files. Also note that unless you specify that the test suites
are rooted here in the contrib directory you'll need to specify
the path from TET_ROOT on the command invocation to tcc,

for example to run the demo suite

	TET_ROOT=tet_root
	export TET_ROOT
	tcc -p -bec contrib/demo

or 
	TET_SUITE_ROOT=$TET_ROOT/contrib
	export TET_SUITE_ROOT
	tcc -p -bec demo
