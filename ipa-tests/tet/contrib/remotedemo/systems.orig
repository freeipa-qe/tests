# copy this file to $TET_ROOT/systems

# normally, you would have real host names in this file, not "localhost";
# but we have defined it like this to reduce the amount of customisation
# that you have to do during this demonstration
# (using "localhost" in this file only works at all if all the systems
# map to "localhost")

000	localhost
# If you run the tests on a mixture of logical (localhost) pseudo
# clients and a real physical remote client, then you need to
# have a real address or host name  for system 000.
