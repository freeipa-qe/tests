# Simple OS/Platform guesser. Similar to config.guess but
# much, much smaller. Since it was developed for use with
# Apache, it follows under Apache's regular licensing
# with one specific addition: Any changes or additions
# to this script should be Emailed to the Apache
# group (apache@apache.org) in general and to
# Jim Jagielski (jim@jaguNET.com) in specific.
#
# Be as similar to the output of config.guess/config.sub
# as possible.
