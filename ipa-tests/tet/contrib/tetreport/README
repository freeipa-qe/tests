Three programs are included:

tetreport - Perl journal file reporting tool.  See the documentation in the
            build directory for instructions how to use. Documentation
	    is provided in html and UNIX manual page format.

TetReports.pl -  Perl Class used to build the three reports (formatted,
                 summary, error)

TetJournal.pl -  Perl Class used to analyse and extract information from a 
                 TET Journal file.  The reports in TetReports are only one set
                 of possible examples for its use.

Installation:
------------
1. You need perl 5.001 or later

2. Put the path to your perl binary at the top of tetreport

3. TetReports.pl and TetJournal.pl may either be installed in a directory 
   called 'class' within your Perl library directory, or the path to these
   files may be specified explicitly in the "require" statements in tetreport

4. Let tetreport loose on some of your journal files:

   eg: tetreport -f journal
