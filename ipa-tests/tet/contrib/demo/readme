TETware demo test suite
(a modified version of the original TET1.10 demo,
which is now in the directory contrib/demo110)


This is the simple TETware demonstration test suite
intended to give familiarity with the
outline structure for a test suite and its
associated files, the test scenario file
and the tcc command.


Test Scenario File:
The file tet_scen is the default scenario or
"test list" to be executed. The example given
has a simple "all" scenario which is used
by default , and several other example test
scenarios that can be called by name.


To run this test suite:

0. Check your environment for running tcc

   - check that TET_ROOT is set in the environment
   - check that tcc can be found in the default PATH

   - change directory to $TET_ROOT/contrib/demo

1.  Build the simple test suite as follows:

	tcc -p -b  contrib/demo

2. Execute the tests, thus:

	tcc -p -e contrib/demo

	tcc -p -e contrib/demo all  # the same as above

3. Clean the tests, thus:

	tcc -p -c contrib/demo

4. Rebuild the tests, thus:

	tcc -p -b contrib/demo

5. Look at the extended examples within the tet_scen scenario file.
   Execute the different test scenarios, thus:

	tcc -ep contrib/demo parallel

	tcc -ep contrib/demo random

	tcc -ep contrib/demo enhanced
