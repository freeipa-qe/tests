TCL API Binding
-----------------

This is a tcl API binding for use with TETware.

This version of a tcl API for TET was originally developed by the OSF.
Some minor changes and bug fixes have been applied for use with TETware.

System Requirements:
--------------------
To use this you need to obtain the tcl and tclX distributions

The official home for Tcl and Tk on the Web is:
        http://www.sunlabs.com/research/tcl    
and
	ftp.smli.com

Extended Tcl (TclX), is a set of extensions to Tcl and is needed
for the signal handling functionality.

Extended Tcl can be downloaded by anonymous FTP from:

   ftp.neosoft.com:/pub/tcl/tclx-distrib/


This has been tested on Linux 1.2.13, 2.0.27 and UnixWare 2.03 using 
tcl 7.6 and tclX7.6.0 and tk4.2, and on  Solaris x86 SunOS 5.5.1 i86pc using
 tcl8.0 / tclX8.0.0b3 and tk8.0       

Porting
--------

You may need to edit any tcl scripts to change the first line
to match the path for your installed tcl interpreter


Change History
---------------

See the SCCS version information and the change
history within the individual files within the API.
