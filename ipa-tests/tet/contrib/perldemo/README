This is a perl version of the simple C API demo suite

To run the simple demo

tcc -p -bec contrib/perldemo

If the execute mode fails, check the !# statement at the top
of each perl file in the ts subdirectory. As delivered it
assumes perl is in /usr/bin/perl, you may need to change this
to /usr/local/bin/perl or /opt/bin/perl.

To run the ETET scenario

tcc -e -v TET_COMPAT=etet -p -s etet_scen contrib/perldemo
