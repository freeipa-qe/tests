1. The DNS reverse lookup checks on Replica
#####################################################################

:: [17:43:49] ::  

This one is happening during ipa_upgrade_master_replica_client_all_1.  It
seems to have other DNS data.  I can see it in IPA.  And, the check 
previously worked in all other tests including the mrc_setup.

2. selinuxusermap checks on Replica

This one is occuring Replica after master upgraded during 
ipa_upgrade_client_replica_master_all_3.  It appears as though the replica
is out of sync.

This one is occuring on the replica during the test 
ipa_upgrade_master_replica_client_nodns_setup.  If you see this, check if 
host has ipv6:  

[root@zippyvm3 httpd]# dig +short blademtv3.lab.sjc.redhat.com aaaa
2000:db8:0:f101::8

In RHEL6.2 there's a problem in the lookup there.  As a fix, I added 
a workaround to add /etc/hosts entries.
