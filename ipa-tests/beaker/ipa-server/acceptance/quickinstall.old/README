This beaker task will install MASTER, SLAVE and CLIENT if all are
supplied in the submitted job xml.  If there are not any SLAVEs 
and/or CLIENTs specified, they will be skipped.  It is necessary
to supply the role of each machine in the recipe in the job xml.

The runtest.sh script has 3 main sections for each or the defined 
roles MASTER, SLAVE, and CLIENT.  These need to be set appropriately 
in the submitted job xml.

master
   	* if the machine has role of MASTER, the required server rpm
     	  packages are installed
	* if all packages are found, rhts-sync commands are used to 
	  block the replica and client from being installed, then
	  installMaster is called.
	* when installMaster finishes, rhts-sync is called to unblock
	  the slave and client to continue with their installs

slave
	* if the machine has role of SLAVE, the required server rpm
          packages are installed
        * if all packages are found, rhts-sync command is used to
          block the slave from installing until the master ready
        * when the master is ready, the installSlave will commence

client
        * if the machine has role of CLIENT, the required client rpm
          packages are installed
        * if all packages are found, rhts-sync command is used to
          block the client from installing until the master ready
        * when the master is ready, the installClient will commence
