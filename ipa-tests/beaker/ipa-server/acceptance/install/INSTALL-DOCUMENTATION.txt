The install tests are split up into three different parts:

1. install
2. install-slave
3. install-client

The Install tests does all of the package installs, and must be run before either of the subsuiquent tests. Every package needed in later tests is installed in this test. 
Following the package installs, if the machine that the test is being run on is a master server, the Install tests sets up and installs a ipa server. 
The options specified vary depending on what is currently needed to make installs work. Generally, pki is disbaled because it causes too many problems. A forwarding DNS server is configured at server install time. 
Slave and Client machines should get configured should have one "nameserver" entry in /etc/resolv.conf that points only at the MASTER server.

The install test should get run on every server that you will use in your test. If the instll test is run on a slave or master server, it does not configure ipa-server.
