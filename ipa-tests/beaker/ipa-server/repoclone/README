This is the nightly ipa repoclone test suite. 

This suite creates a repo of the daily ipa builds to:
https://wiki.idm.lab.bos.redhat.com/dirsec/archives-mp1/archives/ipa/

I had many problems getting beaker to make this test work properly on rhel6. So, the nightly rhel6 runs
should be running rhel-nightly-cron.bash as a cron job on ipadaily-r6-32 and ipadaily-r6-64. 
Those two machines are vm's on giant.idm.lab.bos

You'll need portmap or whatever is needed to mount nfs installed on the machine you'll be using. 

It is important that the machine you run this on is in the 10.16.98/22 subnet because the resulting repo 
is copied to wiki.idm. wiki.idm has problems expoerting nfs mounts outside of this domain.
